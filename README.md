# MealMe

MealMe is a single-page application that uses HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

It also uses the public API TheMealDB, which can be found at: https://www.themealdb.com/

Clicking on "I'm feelin' hungry" without any search criteria will respond with a random meal. With search criteria, a recipe that matches will be returned.
In the event there is no corresponding recipe, an error message will occur, instructing you to try again.
You can favorite the meal, but please note that these favorites will not be persisted in this version of MealMe. 
The version with favorites persisted to a local database can be found here: https://github.com/albercher/MealMe-localDB
